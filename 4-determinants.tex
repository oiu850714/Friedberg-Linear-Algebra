\chapter{Determinants} \label{ch 4}

The \emph{determinant}, which has played a prominent role in the theory of linear algebra, is a special \emph{scalar-valued function} defined \emph{on} the set of \emph{square matrices}.
Although it still has a place in the study of linear algebra and its applications, its role is less central than in former times.
Yet no linear algebra book would be complete without a systematic treatment of the determinant, and we present one here.
However, \emph{the main use of determinants in this book is to compute and establish the properties of \textbf{eigenvalues}}, which we discuss in \CH{5}.

Although the determinant is \emph{not} a linear transformation on \(M_{n x n}(F)\) for \(n > 1\),
(see \RMK{4.1.1})
it does \textbf{possess a kind of linearity} (called \(n\)-linearity) as well as other properties that are examined in this chapter.
In \SEC{4.1}, we consider the determinant on the set of \(2 \X 2\) matrices and derive its important properties and develop an efficient computational procedure.
To illustrate the important role that determinants play \textbf{in geometry}, we also include optional material that explores the applications of the determinant to the study of \textbf{area and orientation}.
In \SEC{4.2} and \SEC{4.3}, we extend the definition of the determinant to all square matrices and derive its important properties and develop an efficient computational procedure.
For the reader who prefers to treat determinants lightly, \SEC{4.4} contains the essential properties that are needed in later chapters.
Finally, \SEC{4.5}, which is optional, offers an \textbf{axiomatic approach} to determinants by showing how to characterize the determinant in terms of \emph{three key properties}.

上面最後一點我們會看到，一個從\ square matrices 打到對應\ field 的函數，只要滿足三個性質，他就是行列式函數。
