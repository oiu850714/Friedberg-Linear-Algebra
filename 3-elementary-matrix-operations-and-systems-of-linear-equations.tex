\chapter{Elementary Matrix Operations and Systems
of Linear Equations} \label{ch 3}

This chapter is devoted to two related objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] the study of certain \emph{``rank-preserving'' operations} on matrices;
\item[2.] the application of these operations and the theory of \LTRAN{}s to the \emph{solution} of systems of linear equations.
\end{enumerate}

As a consequence of objective 1, we obtain a simple method for computing the rank of a linear transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces
\emph{by applying these rank-preserving matrix operations} to a matrix that represents that transformation.

Solving a system of linear equations is probably the most important application of linear algebra.
The familiar method of \emph{elimination} for solving systems of linear equations, which was discussed in \SEC{1.4}, involves the elimination of variables so that a simpler system can be obtained.
The technique by which the variables are eliminated \emph{utilizes three types of operations}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [1.] interchanging any two equations in the system;
\item [2.] multiplying any equation in the system by a \emph{nonzero} constant;
\item[3.] adding a multiple of one equation to another.
\end{enumerate}

In \SEC{3.3}, we express a system of linear equations as a single matrix equation (\(Ax = b\)).
In this representation of the system, the three operations above are the ``\textbf{elementary row operations}'' for matrices(See \DEF{3.1}).
These operations provide a convenient \emph{computational} method for determining all solutions to a system of linear equations.
