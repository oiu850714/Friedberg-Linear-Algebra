\chapter{Diagonalization} \label{ch 5}

This chapter is concerned with the so-called \emph{diagonalization problem}.
For a given linear operator \(\T\) on a \emph{finite}-dimensional vector space \(\V\), we seek answers to the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] Does there exist an ordered basis \(\beta\) for \(\V\) such that \([\T]_{\beta}\) is a \emph{diagonal} matrix?
\item[2.] If such a basis exists, how can it be found?
\end{enumerate}

Since computations involving diagonal matrices are simple, an affirmative answer to question 1 leads us to a \emph{clearer understanding of how the operator \(\T\) acts on \(\V\)},
and an answer to question 2 enables us to obtain easy solutions to many practical problems that can be formulated in a linear algebra context.
We consider some of these problems and their solutions in this chapter;
see, for example, \SEC{5.3}.

We begin this chapter with the study of \emph{eigenvalues} and \emph{eigenvectors}(\DEF{5.2}), which not only play an essential role in the diagonalization problem, but also are \emph{important in their own right}.
Some practical problems involving eigenvalues/eigenvectors are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vibration problems in mechanical systems,
    \item face recognition,
    \item fingerprint authentication, and
    \item the statistical process called \emph{principal component analysis}.
\end{itemize}
