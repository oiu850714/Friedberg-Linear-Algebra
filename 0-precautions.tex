\chapter{Precautions}

\begin{note}
The colors used in proofs are just for notational purpose.
For example: given subspaces \(\W_1, \W_2\) of \(\V\), we have \(\OV \in \W_1 + \W_2\) since \(\OV = \BLUE{\OV} + \GREEN{\OV}\) where \(\BLUE{\OV} \in \W_1\) and \(\GREEN{\OV} \in \W_2\).
In this case, \(\OV, \BLUE{\OV}, \GREEN{\OV}\) are exactly the same.

\begin{note}
I changed the indexing of the theorems/corollaries/examples/exercises/etc in the textbook.

Rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item The definitions in the book have no index, so I add the index, which has the format <chapter>-<starting number>.
\item The examples in the book have index which restarts at every section, and I change the index format as <chapter>-<section>-<starting number>.
\item Exercise: similarly as examples.
\item The theorems in the book have index which restarts at every chapter, and I change the index format as <chapter>-<starting number>.
\item The corollary in the book \emph{always} follows behind a theorem, and I change the index format as <chapter>-<theorem starting number>-<corollary number>.
    Some corollary has no number, in this case I just treat it as corollary 1.
\end{itemize}

In addition, I add \emph{additional definition} for some definitions implicitly stated(without definitions or even examples) in textbook.

Similarly, for some propositions which are proved in the exercises and are likely used in later chapters, I add \emph{additional theorem} which just refer to these exercises.
This is convenient for searching all useful propositions in the book but prevent me from looking for these propositions in the tons of exercises.
