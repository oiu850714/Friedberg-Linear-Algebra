\chapter{Inner Product Spaces} \label{ch 6}

Most applications of mathematics are involved with the concept of \textbf{measurement} and hence of the \textbf{magnitude} or \textbf{relative size} of various \textbf{quantities}.
So it is not surprising that the fields of real and complex numbers, which have a \emph{built-in notion of \textbf{distance}}, should play a special role.
Except for \SEC{6.8}, in this chapter \textbf{we assume that all vector spaces are over either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers}.
See Appendix \ref{sec 8.d} for properties of complex numbers.
We introduce the idea of \textbf{distance} or \textbf{length} into vector spaces via a much richer structure, the so-called \textbf{inner product space structure}.
This added structure provides applications to geometry (Sections 6.5 and 6.11), physics (Section 6.9), conditioning in systems of linear equations (Section 6.10), least squares (Section 6.3) , and quadratic forms (Section 6.8).
